First. A big thank you to [Lars Wilhelmsen](http://www.larswilhelmsen.com/) that showed me how to get a blog in just a few hours. It's hosted on [GitHub](http://github.com) using [Octopress](http://octopress.org). 

During the session a lot of git-commands, rake-stuff and some crazy voodoo made this possible. It wasn't too difficult, and it's easy to find documentation on how to do it. But a helping hand from someone that's already done it helps a lot.

So now I'm writing my first post using [Sublime Text 2](http://www.sublimetext.com/2) and the [Ocropress addon](https://github.com/digal/st2-octopress). As you can see I've found out how to create links in markdown. Check [this guide](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) if u're a noob like me.

Tomorrow I'm going to race at [LÃ¸renskog](http://www.lmbk.no/) with my RC model car. [Here](http://www.myrcm.ch/no/lmbk/20120602_710585/200mm/index.html) you can see if I'm having a great day or not.
